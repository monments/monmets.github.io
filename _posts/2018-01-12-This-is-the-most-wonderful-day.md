Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.

The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. 

我们需要充分的对自己的知识进行收集、整理、分类、利用、分享、创新。每一天在学习的时候都需要不断循环这样的过程，也就是对自己的知识进行有效率的管理利用。有句话说：你需要什么你就会看到什么。当我们找到我们需要模仿的那一类人，我们就要充分的跟他们学习，学习他们是怎么想的，对他们的信息进行收集 分类和利用，所以学习好知识管理对于模仿也是很重要的，因为只有我们学会了知识管理才能实现知识的积累和转化。
