Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?

The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.

At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;在你从你那一堆能力当中找出了一些特别擅长别人又需要的，第二步就是让你这个能力变得专业，因为我们要在网络上提供专业化的服务，怎样让自己变得专业？那就是要深度的模仿，也就是你要快速的磨练自己，快速的成为某个领域的专家。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;模仿其实也是一个创新的过程，也就是说当我们学习某样东西时，要根据他的精髓和核心内容，再结合自己理解按照自己的表达方式来输出，而不是照抄照搬。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;我们需要充分的对自己的知识进行收集、整理、分类、利用、分享、创新。每一天在学习的时候都需要不断循环这样的过程，也就是对自己的知识进行有效率的管理利用。有句话说：你需要什么你就会看到什么。当我们找到我们需要模仿的那一类人，我们就要充分的跟他们学习，学习他们是怎么想的，对他们的信息进行收集 分类和利用，所以学习好知识管理对于模仿也是很重要的，因为只有我们学会了知识管理才能实现知识的积累和转化。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;刻意练习的步骤可以是把一件复杂的事情拆解成很多项简单的项目进行单项练习，比如学写作，你可以单独先练习收集整理素材，等到学会了整理素材，再来单独练习如何列出文章的大纲，接下来的项目以此类推，等到单项练习完成后再把这些结合起来进行一个实战的练习，试着发布一篇文章，写一些文案。得到一些结果或者反馈之后，要及时给予自己奖励，这个奖励不一定是钱，也可以是一个大大的赞，一个认可一个鼓励。及时反馈和奖励能够让你更有信心进行循环的刻意练习。
